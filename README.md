## Description
### // The Idea
In order to enter the building, students at ‘Academia de Código’ must show an ID card provided by the school at the beginning of the course. This real-life situation was transformed into a funny game where students and security guards interact with each other. The player’s role is to move the student in order to get as many ID Cards as possible while escaping from the security guard. If the student gets a bottle of beer instead, a friend will show up to distract the guard, but keyboard disposition changes and moving around becomes more challenging.
### // The Development
Before typing any line of code, we drew the Class Diagrams and practiced the git workflow for the project. We decided to adopt pair programming method so we could collaborate with each other, that approach would help us understand the project in whole. Simple GFX Library was used to implement the graphic interface. At first, we implemented the grid and worked on directions for both player and computer. Then we implemented collision detection and changed graphics. Finally we improved the direction randomizer for smoother movements and added music.
### // My Role
Everybody participated in the coding process and we did it in pairs. My main individual role though was as Git Master. 
### // Tech && Methodologies
Java 7, Simple GFX Library, Git
